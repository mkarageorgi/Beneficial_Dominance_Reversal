## Figure 2
This code reproduces Figure 2.

### How to generate the figure
* First, obtain the relevant file within the data folder. Place the file under `data/`
* Run each R markdown document to generate the figure plot

### Programming environment
The R scripts require the following packages: `c("tidyverse", "data.table", "broom", "boot", "drc", "ggpubr", "kableExtra", "htmltools", "webshot")`.

These packages serve different purposes:
* Data manipulation: `tidyverse`, `data.table` 
* Statistical analysis: `broom`, `boot`, `drc` 
* Visualization: `ggpubr`
* Output formatting: `kableExtra`, `htmltools`, `webshot`

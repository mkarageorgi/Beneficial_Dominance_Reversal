# Figure 1

This code reproduces Figure 1, which shows that organophosphate-resistant _Ace_ alleles persist at intermediate frequencies in natural _Drosophila melanogaster_ populations and respond to spatial and seasonal insecticide selection. The analysis examines the global distribution of I161V resistant allele frequencies in relation to insecticide use intensity, and provides evidence for both spatial and temporal patterns of selection on resistance alleles.
